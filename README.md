# Dendritic rewiring
This is the simulation code used in the paper "[Emergence of Stable Synaptic Clusters on Dendrites Through Synaptic
Rewiring ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00057)".

## Setup
You need Python to run this code. We tested it on Python version 3.7. Additional dependencies are listed in
[environment.yml](environment.yml). If you use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), run

```console
conda env create --file=environment.yml
```

to install the required packages and their dependencies.
